// 2. The following delayMsg function is intended to be used to delay printing a message until
// some time has passed.
// a) What order will the four tests below print in? Why?
// b) Rewrite delayMsg as an arrow function
// c) Add a fifth test which uses a large delay time (greater than 10 seconds)
// d) Use clearTimeout to prevent the fifth test from printing at all.
